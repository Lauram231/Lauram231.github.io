  <p>Hi there! Iâ€™m Laura! Iâ€™m from sunny Phoenix, Arizona, and Iâ€™m currently studying Marketing and Data Analytics. Iâ€™m a big fan of journaling, reading, making art, and pretty much anything that involves being creative or crafty. I also love spending time with my favorite peopleâ€”my family and friends.</p>

  <p>I know Iâ€™ve already mentioned a few hobbies, but I have way too many interests to fit into one paragraph. So here are a few more of my favorite things (not exactly hobbies, but definitely obsessions): Snoopy, Twilight (Team Edward forever), monkeys, the WNBA, moviesâ€”so many moviesâ€”and Rilakkuma.</p>

  <p>My list of dislikes is nowhere near as long as my list of likes, but it does exist (maybe Iâ€™ll share it another time ðŸ˜‰).</p>

  <p>My top three dreams are: working in the WNBA (Go Phoenix Mercury!), traveling all around the world, and living in the coolest city everâ€”Mexico City ðŸŒ†.</p>

  <p>I have a long list of things I love and a tendency to write about all of them, so I decided to create LMNOPages! Iâ€™ve been journaling for years, and this page is my outlet for recording thoughts, memories, and random musings. If youâ€™re reading this, welcome to my brain.</p>
